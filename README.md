# 🛒 Grocery Market Basket Analysis with R and Shiny

This is my first Data Science project in college, built using **R** and the **Shiny UI library**. The project performs **market basket analysis** using **association rule mining** and **customer segmentation** using **K-Means clustering**. The dataset used contains transactional data from a grocery store.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 📊 Interactive **Shiny Dashboard** to explore the data
- 🧺 **Association Rules (Apriori Algorithm)** to find product combinations often bought together
- 📈 **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers/products based on buying behavior
- 🧠 Data preprocessing, visualization, and insights generation
- 🔍 Insightful patterns and visualizations to support business decisions
